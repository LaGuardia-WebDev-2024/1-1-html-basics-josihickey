  <h1>Hope</h1>
  <h5>By Emily Dickinson</h5>
  <p>
    <font size="+2"> Hope</font> is the thing with feathers 
    <br> That perches in the soul, 
    <br> And sings the tune without the words, 
    <br> And never stops at all,
    <br>
    <br>And sweetest in the gale is heard;
    <br>And sore must be the storm
    <br> That could abash the little bird
    <br> That kept so many warm.
    <br>
    <br>I've geard it in the chillest land
    <br>and on the strangest sea;
    <br>Yet, never, in extremity,
    <br> It asked a crumb of me.
  </p>
